  <h2>Professional</h2>
  <p>
  I graduated from <a href="http://www.upa.edu.mx/">Polytechnic University of Aguascalientes</a> with a B.Eng. in Mechatronics. I received the M.S. in Robotics and Advanced Manufacturing from CINVESTAV under the supervision of the professors <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RRm-R20AAAAJ">Vicente Parra</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/francisco-j-ruiz-s%C3%A1nchez/23/890/216">Fransico Ruiz</a>. Since 2012 I am with the Robotics and Automation group of <a href="http://www.centropiaggio.unipi.it/">Research Center E Piaggio</a> of the <a href="http://www2.ing.unipi.it/scuola_dottorato_ingegneria/">Engineering School Leonardo da Vinci </a> at <a href="http://www.unipi.it/">University of Pisa </a> where I am currently working toward the Ph.D degree. My Advisor is the professor <a href="http://www.centropiaggio.unipi.it/~bicchi">Antonio Bicchi</a> and my main research topic is constrained motion planning and execution for soft robots.<br>
  Before starting my master studies I was working first as a Technical Support Engineer in <a href="http://www.trucka.com.mx/#">Trucka</a>, and then in <a href="http://www.gpelectromecanica.com.mx/"> Gp Electromecanica</a>  as an Automation Engineer. Once I got my M.S. degree I worked for the technology center of <a href="http://www.whirlpoolcorp.com">Whirlpool Corporation</a> as Engineer analyst, my job was to perform Multibody Dinamic Simulations. After these experience on industry I decided to follow one of my dreams and try to become a Ph.D. I am in the way.
